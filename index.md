# OpenDrop - Microfluidics Lab-on-a-chip
{% include figure.html file="opendrop_logo.png" caption="OpenDrop Logo" src="http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenDrop/" height="3cm" %}

Description (*drawn from [OpenDrop Official Website](http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenDrop/)*): 

**OpenDrop** is an open source digital microfludics platform for research purposes made by the Swiss company GaudiLabs. The device uses recent electro-wetting technology to control small droplets of liquids. Potential applications are lab on a chip devices for automating processes of digital biology.
The design approach chosen relies strongly on Do-It-Your-Self (DIY) and Low-Cost. The aim is to only use standard and widely-available components, materials, and production processes. Also, all design files and software required to operate your hardware are shared under open licenses (Github: [OpenDrop Repository](https://github.com/GaudiLabs/OpenDrop)).
